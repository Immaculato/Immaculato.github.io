## Welcome to Tristan, Katie, Sydney, and Yang's Group Blog for CS499!

### Divvying up and working on the Coding Assignment report [11/11/2017]
On November 11th, the team divvied out final parts for the Coding Assignment report. Because we only ended up coding on LUNA this semester, our report reflects that by only representing LUNA and the PHP server it uses. 

The part divisons were as follows:

* Katie Long: User Manual, Administrator's Manual (PC)
* Tristan Basil: Administratorâ€™s Manual (Requirements and MAC), Integration Testing, Source code import/QA review
* Sydney Norman: Testing Acceptance Planning and Quality Review
* Yang Xi: Technical Metric Collection

The team decided to try and finish the majority of the report by the end of the 11th to ensure we have enough time to review before Monday.

### Meeting with Kaylynne Glover Friday and the New Goals for our Program [11/10/2017]
This is the post which records the meeting on Friday, November 10th, 2017 at 5pm. Our team met with Ms. Kaylynne Glover to discuss the current state of the coding assignment, and make clear about the future plans. In general, we talked about 4 points. First, the calendar should show what days the user are probably going to have a period. This question will use the onboarding answers. Second, the progress tab needs to be removed. Third, the server needs to switch to BLUEHOST. Fourth, the user should be able to change the data within 24 hours, but no earlier. It means there will be a limit time for user to change their answers. They can not change their answer less than one day since their answers are recorded to the server.

Since the SARA program is still needed to be discussed, our team will wait for the reply of SARA, fix the bug for coding assignment and focus on the maintenance of our program.

### (LATE POST) Meeting with Kaylynne and New Daily Questions [10/25/2017]
This post contains meeting events that are out of order. 

Previously: On Friday, October 13th, the team met with Kaylynne to discuss the updated questions for the "Daily Questions" portion of the app. We discussed how to allow users to preference when they would like to answer questions, if users should be able to answer "Other" for certain questions and fill in the blanks, and talked about the new selfie reporting questions and their format. At the time, we also discussed the compilation issues we were having with Ionic to keep her up to date. These issues are now moot, as we are able to simulate the app.

Currently: Next up is adding the new questions in and maybe updating some onboarding questions. Some of the possible responses make no sense for humans, so we might ask Kaylynne if those are strictly necessary in the application.

### Debugging LUNA [10/20/2017]
On Friday, October 20th, Tristan and Sydney met to debug the issues which don't allow us to open and run LUNA. We determined there were compatibility issues with the versions of Ionic, as well as linking issues with multiple HTTP packages. We were able to correct these issues and document a new set of installation instructions to prevent replication of the issue. We are now able to deploy LUNA to iOS without problems. On to the next task!

### Working Out the Final Architecture Design and Preparing for the Presentation [10/1/2017]
On Sunday, October 1st, the group coordinated to get on at the same time to divvy up the final Architecture Assignment wording, although work was done throughout the week earlier to detail what exactly each part would consist of. It was determined that each member would work on the following:
* Tristan Basil: Architecture diagram and SARA design of methods using PDL
* Katie Long: LUNA UI design and test cases
* Sydney Norman: SARA UI design and test cases
* Yang Xi: LUNA design of methods using PDL

We then ran through each section as a QA review to ensure each was consistent and representative of our project. After reviewing the architecture diagram, method design and UI in particular and making some small changes, we returned to the powerpoint to make final revisions for the presentation tomorrow.

### Meeting in Presentation U [9/29/2017]
On Friday, September 29th, our group had a meeting to prepare for the presentation. The presentation will be held on Monday. Sydney made an appointment for the group with Presentation U to plan and practice the presetation. Also we get guidance in the meeting. The presentation group meeting was held at 2pm on the 3rd floor in FPAT. 

The group identified roles for each person in the meeting: Sydney holds the part of introduction of the whole projct, like outlines and contects; Katie holds the part of introduction of LUNA and SARA details, and also our jobs for LUNA; Yang holds the part of user stories for LUNA and SARA; Tristan holds the part of the introduction and explain of Architecture Diagram.

The whole meeting lasted an hour from 2pm to 3pm. Our tutor explained some of notes that we need to notice in a presentation, and then the group practised two times in the meeting. Since this is just a start for the presentation, after the meeting we still need to do more practice to get familiar with their individual parts over the weekend.

### Meeting During Class Time [9/11/2017]
On Monday, September 11th, Sydney, Tristan, Katie, and Yang met during class time to catch everyone up to speed and begin working on the Project Plan Assignment. Sydney created a Trello board for the team to track progress on the project, and all team members got the boards up and running during the meeting. Tristan and Katie made sure all team members had access to the Github repos, blog, and Google Drive folder.

We spent some time brainstorming for the Project Plan, creating a rough document to begin the assignment, and scheduled time to meet on Friday to polish it up. Each member should have contributed to the document and have a general understanding of what needs to go into it by our meeting later this week.

### First Sponsor Meeting and Team Roles [9/6/2017]
On Wednesday, September 6th, Sydney, Tristan, and Katie met with our client to get our bearings for the project. LUNA isn't currently launchable on iOS devices. Our first priority is getting the app back up and running on the newest iOS update. After that's done, we must add a few new features. For SARA, our priority is getting the email function up and running. We then need to figure out how to create location based emailing, as well as figure out how to communicate report instances (namely, the date), with LUNA.

Additionally, the code for LUNA is now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/LUNA), and the code for SARA s now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/SARA-Fall17).

Our team roles are as follows:
* Katie Long: Software Developer, Product Owner 
* Tristan Basil: Software Developer
* Sydney Norman: Software Developer, Scrum Master
* Yang Xi: Software Developer

Roles might change/develop as the course continues.

### First post! [9/3/17]

Katie, Sydney, and Yang,
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Immaculato/Immaculato.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to edit the Markdown for this site.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files. 

We can also use the config.yml to change up the structure of the website rather than just it's content, if need be. Github built out this page and made it pretty with their [Theme Chooser](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/): It's really cool and saves a lot of time.

Here's a quick guide on [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is what you'll use to edit the README.md.

Feel free to play around!

-Tristan
