## Welcome to Tristan, Katie, Sydney, and Yang's Group Blog for CS499!

### Working Out the Final Architecture Design and Preparing for the Presentation [10/1/2017]
On Sunday, October 1st, the group coordinated to get on at the same time to divvy up the final Architecture Assignment wording, although work was done throughout the week earlier to detail what exactly each part would consist of. It was determined that each member would work on the following:
* Tristan Basil: Architecture diagram and SARA design of methods using PDL
* Katie Long: LUNA UI design and test cases
* Sydney Norman: SARA UI design and test cases
* Yang Xi: LUNA design of methods using PDL

We then ran through each section as a QA review to ensure each was consistent and representative of our project. After reviewing the architecture diagram, method design and UI in particular and making some small changes, we returned to the powerpoint to make final revisions for the presentation tomorrow.

### Meeting in PresentationU [9/29/2017]
On Friday, September 29th, the group had a meeting to prepare for the presentation which will be held on Monday. Sydney made an appointment for the group with PresentationU for practicing and getting guidance. The presentation group meeting was held at 2pm on the 3rd floor in FPAT. 

The group identified roles for each person in the meeting and did some practices with time. The whole meeting lasted an hour from 2pm to 3pm, and the group will practice and get familiar with their individual parts over the weekend.

### Meeting During Class Time [9/11/2017]
On Monday, September 11th, Sydney, Tristan, Katie, and Yang met during class time to catch everyone up to speed and begin working on the Project Plan Assignment. Sydney created a Trello board for the team to track progress on the project, and all team members got the boards up and running during the meeting. Tristan and Katie made sure all team members had access to the Github repos, blog, and Google Drive folder.

We spent some time brainstorming for the Project Plan, creating a rough document to begin the assignment, and scheduled time to meet on Friday to polish it up. Each member should have contributed to the document and have a general understanding of what needs to go into it by our meeting later this week.

### First Sponsor Meeting and Team Roles [9/6/2017]
On Wednesday, September 6th, Sydney, Tristan, and Katie met with our client to get our bearings for the project. LUNA isn't currently launchable on iOS devices. Our first priority is getting the app back up and running on the newest iOS update. After that's done, we must add a few new features. For SARA, our priority is getting the email function up and running. We then need to figure out how to create location based emailing, as well as figure out how to communicate report instances (namely, the date), with LUNA.

Additionally, the code for LUNA is now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/LUNA), and the code for SARA s now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/SARA-Fall17).

Our team roles are as follows:
* Katie Long: Software Developer, Product Owner 
* Tristan Basil: Software Developer
* Sydney Norman: Software Developer, Scrum Master
* Yang Xi: Software Developer

Roles might change/develop as the course continues.

### First post! [9/3/17]

Katie, Sydney, and Yang,
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Immaculato/Immaculato.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to edit the Markdown for this site.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files. 

We can also use the config.yml to change up the structure of the website rather than just it's content, if need be. Github built out this page and made it pretty with their [Theme Chooser](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/): It's really cool and saves a lot of time.

Here's a quick guide on [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is what you'll use to edit the README.md.

Feel free to play around!

-Tristan
