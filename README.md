## Welcome to Tristan, Katie, Sydney, and Yang's Group Blog for CS499!

First post!

Katie, Sydney, and Yang,
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Immaculato/Immaculato.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to edit the Markdown for this site.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files. 

We can also use the config.yml to change up the structure of the website rather than just it's content, if need be. Github built out this page and made it pretty with their [Theme Chooser](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/): It's really cool and saves a lot of time.

Here's a quick guide on [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is what you'll use to edit the README.md.

Feel free to play around!
-Tristan
