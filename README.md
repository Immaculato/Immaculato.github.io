## Welcome to Tristan, Katie, Sydney, and Yang's Group Blog for CS499!

### First Sponsor Meeting and Team Roles
On Wednesday, September 6th, Sydney, Tristan, and Katie met with our client to get our bearings for the project. LUNA isn't currently launchable on iOS devices. Our first priority is getting the app back up and running on the newest iOS update. After that's done, we must add a few new features. For SARA, our priority is getting the email function up and running. We then need to figure out how to create location based emailing, as well as figure out how to communicate report instances (namely, the date), with LUNA.

Additionally, the code for LUNA is now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/LUNA), and the code for SARA s now available [here](https://github.com/katrinamo/SARA-Fall17).

Our team roles are as follows:
*Katie Long: Software Developer, Scrum Master
*Tristan Basil: Software Developer
*Sydney Norman: Software Developer
*Yang Xi: Software Developer

Roles might change/develop as the course continues. 

### First post!

Katie, Sydney, and Yang,
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Immaculato/Immaculato.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to edit the Markdown for this site.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files. 

We can also use the config.yml to change up the structure of the website rather than just it's content, if need be. Github built out this page and made it pretty with their [Theme Chooser](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/): It's really cool and saves a lot of time.

Here's a quick guide on [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which is what you'll use to edit the README.md.

Feel free to play around!
-Tristan
